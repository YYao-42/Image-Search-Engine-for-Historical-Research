## Documents

To better inform the members of the project progress and understand each other's work, we will keep updating two online documents as the project progresses. 

- Project documentation: https://hackmd.io/@yyao/H17LYJEKF/edit

- Appendix: https://hackmd.io/@yyao/rk4UNPIFY/edit

**Please always update them when you make modifications to the codes.**

## Collaborative Workflow

#### Basic Shared Repository Workflow

- update your local repo with `git pull origin master`,
- create a working branch with `git checkout -b MyNewBranch`
- make your changes on your branch and stage them with `git add`,
- commit your changes locally with `git commit -m "description of your commit"`, and
- upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub with `git push origin MyNewBranch`
- go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
- click on your branch name
- click on “Pull Request” button (URC)
- click on “Send Pull Request”
